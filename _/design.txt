1) Why trait bars with a max value and then write the overheal number next to it? A few reasons:
	a) 	A dynamic pip bar is a bit confusing, because it's not clear when the max value is increasing or decreasing;
		the only visual cue would be all the pip separator lines being moved, but the bar would stay the same size
		(unless you grow the bar, but then you run into issues with UI layout with bars growing very large or small)
	b)	Game balance issues where it might be possible to increase your max trait values arbitrarily high by stalling
		inside a fight. Fixing the max value at the beginning of a fight allows people to use overheal as a mechanic
		within fights and also opens up design possibilities for skills or passives related to overhealed traits
		(such as being able to add 1 point of an overhealed trait to your maximimum trait value at the end of every fight)
