1) Let the player make a plan, and execute the plan. (i.e., the system can be understood enough to make reasonable plans; it's not random, it's systematic)
2) It can't be the same plan every time, or it's not interesting.
3) What specific things did the player have to understand to make this plan? And then start exploring around that space, enumerate it precisely, what can we add to that list?
4) Analogy with music: stating a theme, building the theme into something larger, revisiting themes, etc.
5) Once you have at least two things, you can start combining them in variations (light/weak enemy, strong/heavy enemy, mortar guy, combine them in different ways).
6) How do I make the map layout matter? Are different layouts really different in terms of gameplay? [What about having "themed" sections that give the player access to certain things, whether that's specific fights, drops, etc. e.g., a jungle area that has hard enemies but has good materials you can gather]
7) Discontinuities (chaos) in game state. e.g., if the tree were 2 inches to the right, this whole plan wouldn't work at all because it blocks some line of sight -- these kinds of discontinuities make things interesting, rather than just a simple continuous/smooth optimization problem. The way to get these discontinuities is non-linearities and many-dimensional problem spaces.
